#### Elements of design patterns
- **Pattern name**: useful vocabulary that is used to describe the pattern.
- **Problem applicability and area of applicability**: describes the area where the pattern can be applied and the problem it can solve.
- **Solution**: the solution to the problem to which it was designed for in that problem domain.
- **Consequences of applying that design pattern**: it should specify the course of the whole process, the pros and cons of applying that design pattern.

#### They are categorized in 3 namely:
- **[Creation](./creational)** - _Provide a wat to create objects while hiding the creation logic rather than instantiating objects directly.This give the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use-case_
- **[Structural](./structural)** - _Is concerned with clas and object composition to obtain new functionalities and form larger structures_
- **[Behavioural](./behavioural/readme.md)** - _Is concerned by communication between objects by identifying common communication patterns between objects._
